# Interview Exercise F

This technical interview project is suited for a Front End App Developer role.

Your goal is to create a filterable list of employees based on the provided data and Figma comps.

To help jump start the assignment, we've created an app shell with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and preinstalled the latest Bootstrap, as well as a component framework and a typeahead. Not included is any actual code from the site.

We want to be clear that is not spec work and your code will not be used for anything else than this interview.

## Goals

- Assess your abilities as they relate to React, javascript, html and css.
- Identify your areas of strength

## Instructions

**We estimate this should take an around 90-120 minutes.**

You are welcome to use any libraries or packages in addition to bootstrap and scss.

### The Scenario

Our app needs to display a list of people and enable filtering by age. You should have received a link to a Figma file. We have comps for mobile and desktop, but the list needs to look good at any width. We'll leave the details of the in-between views up to you.

- We've provided a very basic app layout. Feel free to add to it and adjust as needed
- Consider how interactions might occur on a touch screen vs standard keyboard / mouse
- Consider best practices in regard to accessibility.

## Developer Setup

This code was assembled with Node 16. It may work on earlier, but if all else fails, be sure to run from 16.

## Running the Code

From the root directory, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Good luck!
